# InjaChat: Our T3 Chat Cloneathon Submission üöÄ

## üìù 1. Project Overview

Welcome to **InjaChat**! This project is our official entry into the **T3 Chat Cloneathon**, an exciting open-source competition initiated by Theo (`@theo` on X/Twitter). Our goal is to build a high-quality, open-source AI chat application that closely mirrors the functionalities and user experience of T3 Chat, but with a crucial difference: **it's entirely built using Svelte 5 and SvelteKit.**

We are striving to leverage the performance, reactivity, and developer-friendly nature of Svelte to create a compelling alternative within the AI chat application landscape. This repository serves as our active development space for this challenge.

## üéØ 2. Purpose & The Cloneathon

This project exists primarily to participate in and win the **T3 Chat Cloneathon**. We believe in the power of Svelte and aim to showcase its capabilities in building complex, real-time applications by taking on this challenge.

### About the T3 Chat Cloneathon:
